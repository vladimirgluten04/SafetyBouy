# SafetyBouy

        all of the files that I Created for the innovative rowing safety buoy.

        the buoy collects environmental data from three main sensors: A sonic doppler effect anemometer that measures wind speed based on the change in the speed of sound through air, two DBS1280 onewire temperature sensors that measure both the air and the water temperature, and a precipitation sensor that measures the density of live precipitation 

        it then sends this information via IOT Cell to a server running an algorith that determines the safety conditons on the lake and gives a rowing peril number from 0-28 Morts. this is a platform that can gather data with more accuracy and transmit it with more range than anything in its price range. It will allow Rowing teams and others using lakes and rivers to understang the conditions without driving all the way to the water. It also displays the information in an understandable, easy to read format

        the program is aimed to demystify the safety conditions that coaches learn with experience and since it is all open source, it can easily be adjusted for local conditions and perfered parameters
