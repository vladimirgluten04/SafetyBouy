# SafetyBouy
all of the files that I Created for the innovative rowing safety buoy.
the buoy collects environmental data from three main sensors: A sonic doppler effect anemometer that measures wind speed based on the change in the speed of sound through air, two DBS1280 onewire temperature sensors that measure both the air and the water temperature, and a precipitation sensor that measures the density of live precipitation 
it then sends this information via IOT Cell to a server running an algorith that determines the safety conditons on the lake and gives a rowing peril number from 0-28 Morts. this is
